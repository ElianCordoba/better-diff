This is a high-level overview of the second version of the algorithm. I'm reworking the whole system to solve the following issues that arise during the development of the previous version and, despite the efforts, I couldn't build the existing architecture to solve them. So I'm starting from scratch with those limitations in mind, these are: 

# High prio

## Score based matching
Before we would only match perfect sequences, this means that the slightest of changes would disrupt the matching. 
In the new version, we are going to have a score function that would assign a score from (tentatively) 0 to 100 and the highest scoring subsequence will be picked.

Some notes:
- Still need to define the score function, it could include the following data
  - Text content
  - Kind
  - Line and position (close changes are preferred)
  - Number of nodes in between (fewer nodes in between preferred)
- Score should be above a given threshold to match

Example
```ts
function asd() {
  return 123
}

// vs

function ddd() {
  return 333
}
```

This should match a single move

## Moves now contain sections
Before we would create a move saying, "From X to Y it moved to A and B, limiting us to a single section, this is why we had to include the closing node as a separate field. Also, this single-section approach will limit us considering the above point where now a move could be, for example:
"perfect match", "addition", "perfect match"

So moves should have an array of sections

TODO: Check if we can remove the open/close verifier with this

## Use all the AST nodesData changes
Right now we are using the "textual" nodes, but we should use the full AST. For example, to solve the semantic diff case that arises with JS ASI
```js
function asd() {
  return 1
}

// vs 

function asd() {
  return
  1
}
```

This will also simplify the language setup as you won't need to include which nodes are considered "textual". TODO: Or at least not in TS because we can check if a node is the leaf node. Unsure if this assumption will hold for all other compilers

## Alignment
Haven't planned how to implement this but this has to be for version 1.0

Also we need to consider the case where `startLine !== endLine` form example tagged template literals

## Algo steps visualizer
We should create a `recordStep` function that tracks the current "Thinking" for the algorithm. This should be visualized in the front end (or terminal) by clicking forward / backwards. 
This is going to be pretty important to debug the algo, especially useful in tricky scenarios

# Low prio

## Better organize code
We should have the possibility to override functions to experiment with new behaviours, for example how we diff code either with the string-to-string method or the zigzag algo

## UNSURE | Use AST instead of flattened array
TODO: Think why this is needed. In any case, we can have the iterator abstract this away

## Intra-node diffing
In the current approach, we consider the following a change

```ts
123123
'asdasd'

// ---
1233123
'asddasd'
```

While is true a better output would be to use Myers algo to diff the values

## Change type
I tinkered with this idea in the past, some experimentation is needed, the idea is that in some cases, instead of reporting an addition and deletion we can link both in a "change" for example:

```js
const value = 123

// vs 

const value = true
```

## Cross file diffs

## Brainstorm 3-way merge

## Highlighting
Maybe we have some business here

## Tree sitter & other languages
Also having languages communicate via RPC or something, right now we are loading typescript in a JS module, this will prevent us from using a non-js compiler
Maybe here we can also conside sublanguages, an HTML file can have JS and CSS as well as HTML code
